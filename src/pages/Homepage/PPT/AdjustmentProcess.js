              We often don't realize how dependent we are on our senses until we lose one. Even losing taste, as you might experience when sick, suddenly highlights its importance. The adjustment process for vision loss can be even more significant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Losing vision or any other sense requires an adjustment period. This can be challenging and involves learning new ways to navigate the world, both physically and emotionally. Be patient with yourself and seek resources to help you adapt.
            </p>
            <p>
              Counseling can be invaluable. Talking to a professional counselor or support group can provide emotional support, help you process your feelings, and develop coping strategies.
